# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a standard Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C#.

## How to Use

You can easily try out the game by copying and pasting Program.cs into an online C# compiler. Follow these steps:

1. Open your favorite C# online compiler (e.g., [dotnetfiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/), [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/csharp-programming/online-compiler/), etc.).
2. Create a new C# project or paste the entire code inside Program.cs into the code editor.
3. Run the project to play the Tic Tac Toe game.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take turns marking a vacant spot with their respective symbols (X or O).
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
- If the grid is full and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

Feel free to explore the code and make any modifications or improvements as you see fit!
